            <h3>What is Eagle Ninja?</h3>
            <div style="display: none;">
              <p>Eagle Ninja is a platform for sending prospects and clients on mobile missions (“Quests”) so that they can learn of new features or products, interact and engage with a brand or point of sale, and gamify mobile advertising. </p>
              <p>Mobile Quests can be offline or online, and can take place within the Eagle Ninja native Apps on the App Store and Google Play, or through our Appless Responsive mobile web platform.</p>

            What is a Quest?
            </h3>
            <div style="display: none;">
              <p>A Quest is a “Mission” whereby we ask prospects or clients to go to a certain location, or download a certain app, or visit a certain website, view a certain video clip, take a selfie or picture, scan a bar code, play a branded micro game, upload a screenshot, answer questions and similar activities in any type of combination.</p>

            <h3>
            What kinds of quests are there?
            </h3>
            <div style="display: none;">
              <p>Quests can be launched within our native apps on the Appstore and Google Play, or by generating a link that launches an apples responsive based Quest.</p>
              <p>Rewards and incentives for Quests can take the form of monetary rewards, promotional coupons, contributions to favourite causes, or digital points.</p>
              <p>Quests can be offline, online or combinations.</p>
              <p>Quests can be accessed from iOS and Android smartphones, as well as via the desktop when using our Appless Responsive Mobile Web Platform</p>
            </div>

            <h3>
            Can quests be accssed from the desktop?
            </h3>
            <div style="display: none;">
              <p>Quests can be accessed from iOS and Android smartphones, as well as via the desktop when using our Appless Responsive Mobile Web Platform</p>

            <h3>
            How are monetary rewards paid?
            </h3>
            <div style="display: none;">
              <p>We use PayPal to reward participants of monetary Quests that have been approved.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>
            How are promotional coupons delivered
            </h3>
            <div style="display: none;">
              <p>Quests that are approved and that have a promotional coupon as a reward show the alphanumeric coupon code on a screen once the Quest has been approved, as well as sending it via email to the participant.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>
            How are quests approved?
            </h3>
            <div style="display: none;">
              <p>Each completed Quest is reviewed to verify that the participant successfully completed their “Mission”. Once that review has been completed, which can take up to 24 hours, participants are notified that their Quest has been approved and they can then claim their reward.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>
            How long are quests available for?
            </h3>
            <div style="display: none;">
              <p>The time during which Quests are available can be set to as short as a few hours, or as long as many months.</p>
              <p>In addition, each Quest can have a maximum time available to complete, such that once a Quest has been started or reserved, there are X hours (or days or weeks) for the Quest to be completed, and if it is not completed in that time frame, the Quest “slot” expires and is reassigned for other participants as long as the Quest is still available.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>
            How many participants can be invited to a quest?
            </h3>
            <div style="display: none;">
              <p>As many as you like. You can define X number of “slots” that will be available for participants to start or serve a Quest, and that is the maximum number that will be allowed to start or reserve a Quest.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>
            What does reserving a quest mean?
            </h3>
            <div style="display: none;">
              <p>A participant may wish to conduct a Quest, but at that moment does not have time to start it, so by reserving it they ensure that a Quest slot has been assigned to them, and they can then start it at any time as long as the Quest has not expired (the maximum time allotted to finish the Quest has not been reached).</p>
            </div>

            What kind of location, demographic and other triggers can I define in a quest?
            </h3>
            <div style="display: none;">
              <p>If you use our native apps in the Appstore or Google Play you can set geographic location filters, demographic filters, installed app filters, previously conducted Quest filters and answers to previously conducted Quest filters.</p>
