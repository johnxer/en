<h2><a class="dark" href="index.php#welcome"><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a> Privacy</h2>

<h2 style="margin-top: 60px;">What Eagle Ninja Corp Collects</h2>
<h3>Account Creation</h3>
<p>Because Eagle Ninja Corp is a professional service, we require certain personally identifying information ("PII") during the account setup process to establish your identity. In addition, if you provide permission when logging into our service through the Facebook or Google + login we collect a series of additional information you have on file with either or both of these services.</p>

Eagle Ninja Corp may share anonymous aggregate information to our customers in the form of metrics, etc.</p> 

<h3>Location</h3>
<p>Each time you launch the Eagle Ninja Corp app, we collect your location information to best determine what Quests to invite you to. We may share this information in aggregate form so that potential Quest sponsors and customers may understand how our members use the service. If you accept a Quest invitation we may show an Eagle Ninja Corp sponsor or customer your location when you accepted the Quest. If you accepted to do a Quest and perform the Quest, an Eagle Ninja Corp sponsor or customer may see the specific location where you performed the Quest.</p>

<h3>Payment</h3>

<h2 style="margin-top: 60px;">What Information Eagle Ninja Corp Shares</h2> 
<h3>With Eagle Ninja Corp Sponsors and Customers</h3>
<p>Our sponsors and customers work with us to invite certain Ninjas to Cash Quests or Promotinal Coupon Quests or Donation based Quests or Shuriken (Digital Point based) Quests. When you undertake a Quest, the location information, profile, date and time of day and Quest results becomes the property of Eagle Ninja Corp and/or of the Eagle Ninja Corp sponsor or customer. In addition to the content created during a Quest, we will share your location at the time you performed the Quest, the date & time of day, profile information and other data relating to you as the Ninja (Particpant) and relating to the Quest.</p>
