SHURIKEN QUESTS ARE A FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT, AND WHILE YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ACCEPT A SHURIKEN QUEST, OR TO COMPLETE ONE ONCE ACCEPTED OR RESERVED, EAGLE NINJA CORP IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO REDEEM ANY OF YOUR SHURIKEN POINTS, EVEN IF IT HAS DONE SO IN THE PAST, OR HAS DONE SO WITH SOME NINJAS.</p>

               <li><h3>Independent Contractor Relationship</h3>
                  <p>Nothing in this Agreement is intended or should be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, or employer-employee relationship between Eagle Ninja Corp and a Ninja or between an Eagle Ninja Corp Sponsor and a Ninja.

                     <li><strong>Taxes</strong>. Ninjas are solely responsible for filing all tax returns and submitting all payments as required by any federal, state, local, or foreign tax authority arising from the payment of Incentives to Ninjas under this Agreement, and Ninjas agree to do so in a timely manner. If applicable, Eagle Ninja Corp will report the Incentives paid to Ninjas under this Agreement by filing Form 1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law.</li>
                     <li><strong>Compliance with Law</strong>. Ninjas will comply with all applicable federal, state, local, and foreign laws governing self-employed individuals, including laws requiring the payment of taxes, such as income and employment taxes, and social security, disability and other contributions.</li>

If the Dispute is not resolved in this manner within forty-five (45) days of a party's notice of a Dispute, then any party may serve a notice on the other party requiring the Dispute to be submitted to arbitration as follows:
                        <ol>
                           <li>Any Dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less than five thousand U.S. Dollars (US$ 5,000.00) may be resolved in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. Such arbitration shall be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution provider ("<strong>ADR Provider</strong>") that offers arbitration as set forth in this section and under the rules of such ADR Provider, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with this Agreement. The party demanding arbitration will propose an ADR Provider and the other party shall not unreasonably withhold consent to use such ADR Provider. The ADR Provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; b) all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English; c) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and d) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</li>
                           <li>Any other Dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable) shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "<strong>Rules</strong>") and shall be administered by the San Francisco, California office of JAMS (the "<strong>Administrator</strong>"). To the extent there is any conflict between the provisions set forth in this section and any procedural or other rules issued by the Administrator, this section will control. The location of the arbitration will be San Francisco, California USA. The Dispute(s) shall be submitted to a single arbitrator ("<strong>Arbitrator</strong>") chosen by the parties or selected by the parties from a list of potential arbitrators provided by the Administrator. The Administrator shall provide such list to the parties 10 days after request by either party. Should the parties be unable to agree on a choice of arbitrator within 10 days after receipt of the list from the Administrator, then the Administrator will select the Arbitrator. The arbitral proceedings, and all pleadings and written evidence will be in the English language. Any written evidence originally in a language other than English will be submitted in an English translation accompanied by the original or true copy thereof. The English language version will control. Each party shall bear its own attorney's fees, costs, and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the Administrator and the Arbitrator; provided, however, the Arbitrator shall be authorized to determine whether a party is the prevailing party, and if so, to award to that prevailing party reimbursement for its reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (including, for example, expert witness fees and expenses, photocopy charges, travel expenses, etc.), and/or the fees and costs of the Administrator and the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The Arbitrator will not have authority to award damages in excess of the amount, or other than the types, allowed by Section 9 of this Agreement. Judgment on the award of the Arbitrators may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The Arbitrator also shall be authorized to grant any temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief it deems just and equitable and within the scope of this Agreement, including, without limitation, an injunction or order for specific performance. The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by California law or United States Federal law.</li>
                           <li>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may proceed directly to any court of competent jurisdiction to seek protection or enforcement of its intellectual property rights and/or to seek injunctive relief or other equitable relief.</li>
                        </ol>

                     <li><strong>No Assignment</strong>. This Agreement and your rights and obligations under this Agreement may not be assigned, delegated, or otherwise transferred, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by you without Eagle Ninja Corp's express prior written consent.
